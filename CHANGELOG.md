It is also officially documented in the official site: https://casbin.org/docs/en/adapters#:~:text=Ptype%20Column.%20Name%20of%20this%20column%20should%20be%20ptype%20instead%20of%20p_type%20or%20Ptype

* This package has been rewritten to TypeScript.

Signed-off-by: Zxilly <zhouxinyu1001@gmail.com>
* Function name changed to separate it from mongo session transactions

* fix(adapter.js:savepolicy): empty model should not throw an MongoError, it should return false

Previously MongoError would have been thrown since it's trying to save an empty list.

* refactor(debug): add a warning when transaction starts or aborts instead of constant debugging

* test(unit/adapter.test.js): add unit tests for missing functions and add lcov reporter to nyc

* test(integration/adapter.test.js:savepolicy): add sinon to improve empty savePolicy testing

* test(integration/adapter.test.js): add more complex model and policy to test populated v0-v4 values

Previous models only populated fields 0-2

* test(integration/adapter.test.js): failing tests for non-synced adapter transactions

* feat(adapter.js): add support for addPolicies and removePolicies in replicaset environments

* feat(.travis.yml): initial replicaset configuration

- Try rs.initiate and then loop over rs.status to check whether replicaset has been configured

* test(helpers.js): change tests to replicaset for now

* test(.travis.yml): try Bottle-Mongo's Travis-CI setup

https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle-mongo/blob/master/.travis.yml

* test(helpers.js): change replicaset connections to 2 nodes

* test(.travis.yml): add rs.status() command to the end of before-script

* test(.travis.yml, rs_status.js): add more complicated replicaset status check

https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle-mongo/blob/f3a0187cc890ac8265840411e8cf77ed4020a0e4/.travis/rs_create.js

* docs(adapter.js): clarify savePolicyLine since it actually does not save anything

* improvement(adapter.js, errors.js): add functionality to automatically abort and commit transactions

* style(rs_status.js): remove double semicolon

* improvement(adapter.js, errors.js): allow synced adapter for all connections

MongoDB should handle error cases when trying to do transactions in improper environments. This
library should not govern it.

* style: raise errors from missing semicolons (eslint changes reverted)
* **package.json:** Async functions return promises which will inherenty break the expected return
values of all functions. (As an example from Boolean into Promise<Boolean>)
